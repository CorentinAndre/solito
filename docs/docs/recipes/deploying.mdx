title: Deploying
---

Using both Github Actions and the tools provided by companies such as Vercel, we can deploy both our web app and update our mobile app on each commit.


## Web

Deploying to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) works out of the box when you link your project via GitHub.


## Expo

While Expo doesn't have a GitHub integration like Vercel, they do offer documentation for setting up deployments via Github Action to publish on each commit: [Expo Github Actions](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/github-actions/)

However, Expo's docs don't account for a monorepo structure. By adding in `working-directory` to the Expo Github action, you can run `eas update` in the correct directory.

```yml title=".github/workflows/update.yml"
- name: Publish update
  run: eas update --auto
  working-directory: ./apps/expo
```
