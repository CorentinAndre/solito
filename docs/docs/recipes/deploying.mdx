title: Deploying
---

Using both Github Actions and the tools provided by companies such as Vercel, we can deploy both our web app and update our mobile app on each commit to our `main` branch.

## Expo

Expo has excellent documentation for setting up their Github Action to publish on each commit: [Expo Github Actions](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/github-actions/)

However, it doesn't take into account a monorepo structure. By adding in `working-directory` to the Expo Github action, this ensures the action runs `eas update` in the correct directory.

```yml title=".github/workflows/update.yml"
- name: Publish update
  run: eas update --auto
  working-directory: ./apps/expo
```

## Web

Deploying to Vercel works out of the box, Vercel knows where your NextJS project is but using Solito comes with the added benefit of TurboRepo.
